### Objective

To make things and break things. To work with great people who like to do the same. 
To architect teams and solutions focused on breaking things and preventing said breakage.

### Bio

Kernelsmith is a "jack-of-all" trades.  He has a BS in aeronautical engineering
from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institue in Troy, NY and an MA in Management of
Information Systems from the University of Great Falls, MT.  He also started an
MS in Computer Science from Johns Hopkins University, but decided that playing
with his kids and hacking were more important.  Josh spent the first decade of
his professional career as an officer in the U.S. Air Force where he had many
odd jobs including nuclear ICBM launch officer, systems engineer, and action
officer for a 3-star general.  Most importantly however, he was lucky enough to
land at the 92d Information Warfare Aggressor Squadron (later Information
Operations Squadron).  At the 92d (yes, that's how the military says 92nd), he
was finally allowed to get his hands dirty with vulnerability assessments,
pentests, and red teaming.  Post-military, he became a security engineer at the
Johns Hopkins Univ. Applied Physics Lab (JHUAPL) doing and learning all sorts of
cool stuff, most of it classified, but also started contributing to the
Metasploit Framework.  Josh is now very humbled to be both a Metasploit
developer and a security researcher at the Zero Day Initiative where he gets to
reverse engineer all sorts of cool 0-day and architect and implement solutions 
to challenges facing the "world's largest, vendor-agnostic, bug bounty program".

## Background

### Experience

####Short Version

Extensive experience in executing and managing network vulnerability assessments
& penetration tests.  Skilled in network vulnerability analysis including
identification and remediation of vulnerabilities, development and application
of network security technologies, data capture and analysis.  Experienced in
computer system/network vulnerability and exploit research and malware
analysis.  Currently evaluating and reverse engineering submitted and discovered
zero-day vulnerabilities for exploitability and root-cause analysis. Can
navigate easily in Windows/Linux/Unix/OS X command-line and graphical
environments.  Capable in multiple programming and scripting languages, but by
far most proficient in Ruby.

  analyst, and vulnerability researcher.  Performed information security
  assessments of non-standard computing systems such as weapon systems.
  Supported the Information Technology Services Department during major
  intrusions and intrusion attempts and consulted on the security assessment
  and purchase of various enterprise security technologies.

  In the Applied Information Sciences Department, acted as measurements team
  lead for APL’s proposal to phase I of DARPA's National Cyber Range.
  Determined pertinent metrics for various experimentation scenarios and
