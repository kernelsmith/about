### Objective To make things and break things.  Great things.  To work with
great people who like to do the same.  To eventually manage people and projects
focused on making great things aimed at breaking things.

## The Legend:

### Experience Short Version

Extensive experience in executing and managing network vulnerability assessments
& penetration tests.  Skilled in network vulnerability analysis including
identification and remediation of vulnerabilities, development and application
of network security technologies, data capture and analysis.  Experienced in
computer system/network vulnerability and exploit research and malware
analysis.  Currently evaluating and reverse engineering submitted and discovered
zero-day vulnerabilities for exploitability and root-cause analysis. Can
navigate easily in Windows/Linux/Unix/OS X command-line and graphical
environments.  Capable in multiple programming and scripting languages, but by
far most proficient in Ruby.

Long Version

* Senior Security Researcher, NSS Labs, Austin, TX  2012 - 2013

  Researched and applied exploitation, evasion, & obfuscation techniques to add
  depth and realism to security device tests.  Automated application of these
  techniques,when possible, and other test processes such as network traffic
  replay.  Lead initial execution of “breach detection” testing.  Designed and
  developed automated testing framework in Ruby.

* Senior Cyber Security Engineer (Senior Professional Staff II), JHUAPL, Laurel,
  MD, 2008 - 2012

  In the Asymmetric Operations Department, provided computer system and network
  security engineering support to various classified and unclassified programs,
  technical lead for US Government sponsored test project, cyber red team
  analyst, and vulnerability researcher.  Performed information security
  assessments of non-standard computing systems such as weapon systems.  
  Supported the Information Technology Services Department during major
  intrusions and intrusion attempts and consulted on the security assessment
  and purchase of various enterprise security technologies.

  In the Applied Information Sciences Department, acted as measurements team
  lead for APL’s proposal to phase I of DARPA's National Cyber Range.
  Determined pertinent metrics for various experimentation scenarios and
  developed the metrics collection and storage program for the proposal leading
  to a multi-million dollar phase II contract.

* United States Air Force, Air Force InfornationOperations Center, Lackland AFB,
  TX, 2005 - 2008
  
  As Assessment Operations Flight Commander & Team Chief, C4 Systems Security
  Engineer, led 50 military/civilian/contractor computer system and network
  assessments flight.  Responsible for successful execution of 45+ security
  assessments annually.  Personally, performed assessments of weapons systems,
  medical systems, warning systems, support systems, and base infrastructure.
  Responded to real-world intrusions as directed, and emulated enemy cyber
  forces.  Actions included identification and remediation of network, host, and
  application vulnerabilities as well as identification & investigation of
  suspicious network traffic.  Interfaced with National Security Agency, Air
  Force Office of Special Investigations, Joint Task Force-Global Network
  Operations, and Air Force Network Operations Centers and incident response
  teams.

* USAF, Electronic Systems Center, Hanscom AFB, MA, 2002 - 2005

  As Systems Engineering Lead & Commander’s Action Officer, led 50-member (gov
  civilian/MITRE/contractor) systems engineering acquisition team designing
  military satellite communication terminal capability; managed system
  requirements, specification development, design, and technical risk.  As
  action officer for 3-star AF General/Program Executive Officer (PEO)
  responsible for 300+ government acquisition programs, created and delivered
  senior staff briefings, wrote & tracked executive correspondence.

* USAF, 341st Space Wing, Malmstrom AFB, MT, 1999 - 2002 Missile Combat Crew
  Commander & Instructor

  As instructor, developed and taught training for 250 missile officers.
  As crew commander, commanded 50-150 nuclear ICBMs, 20 2-person crews, and $8B
  in equipment during 24-hr missile “alert” duties.  Led unit through extended
  alert duty (120 hrs/5 days) in response to the events of 9/11/01.
