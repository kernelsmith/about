##This is an attempt at adding clickable footnotes to markdown files.
Most of the real work came from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25579868/how-do-i-add-footnotes-to-github-flavoured-markdown

This is some text.  It is super cool.  It has a footnote<sup name="a1">[1](#footnote1)</sup>

This is some more text, it is less super cool, but still pretty cool.

This is some really boring text.  Tastes like burning.
